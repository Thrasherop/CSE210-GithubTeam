My name is Josh, and I am a Software Engineering
major. I've been programming Python for a couple
years now, but I don't have much experience in
Python classes.

My name is Brigham, and my major is Computer Science.
I never had experience programming before, so I hope 
we all can improve togeher. Let`s blast!
