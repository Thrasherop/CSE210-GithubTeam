My name is Josh, and I am a Software Engineering
major. I've been programming Python for a couple
years now, but I don't have much experience in
Python classes.

My name is Jaden, and I am also a Software 
Engineering major. I have been programming on and
off for a few years now, but Python is the only
language that I am particularly comfortable in.
I don't have any experience with programming with
classes.
