My name is Josh, and I am a Software Engineering
major. I've been programming Python for a couple
years now, but I don't have much experience in
Python classes.

My name is Jaden, and I am also a Software 
Engineering major. I have been programming on and
off for a few years now, but Python is the only
language that I am particularly comfortable in.
I don't have any experience with programming with
classes.


My name is Brigham, and my major is Computer Science.
I never had experience programming before, so I hope 
we all can improve togeher. Let`s blast!

Hello! My name is Ethan McRae. I am a Software engineering 
major currently studying at BYU-Idaho. I've taught myself 
most of what I know so far but my classes are reinforcing 
good programming practices. I'm excited to program for a 
living!
